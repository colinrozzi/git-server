# Empty Repository Push Implementation
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ TODO  
**Priority**: High

## Goal
Enable pushing commits from a local repository to a completely empty GitProtocol v2 server.

## Root Requirement
From empty initial state, users should be able to:
```bash
git push <remote> <branch>```

## High-Level Flow Analysis
1. Client discovers server capabilities via `GET /info/refs?service=git-receive-pack`
2. Client sends pack file via `POST /git-receive-pack`
3. Server parses pack file, validates objects
4. Server updates repository state with new objects
5. Server creates/updates refs
6. Server returns success status

## Current Missing Components
- [ ] Receive-pack capability advertisement
- [ ] Pack file parsing infrastructure
- [ ] Receive-pack command handler
- [ ] Repository state mutation for new objects
- [ ] Ref updates (creation/updates)
- [ ] Status reporting back to client

## Task Dependencies
```
empty-repository-push
â”œâ”€â”€ receive-pack-capabilities   [DEP: --]
â”œâ”€â”€ pack-file-parsing          [DEP: --]
â”œâ”€â”€ receive-pack-handler      [DEP: receive-pack-capabilities, pack-file-parsing]
â”œâ”€â”€ repository-updates        [DEP: pack-file-parsing]
â”œâ”€â”€ ref-management            [DEP: repository-updates]
â””â”€â”€ status-reporting          [DEP: repository-updates, ref-management]
```

## Testing Strategy
1. **Manual Test**: Create repo locally, push to empty server
2. **Verify**: Server state saved correctly
3. **Follow-up**: Then clone back and verify integrity

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Manual push test succeeds
- [ ] Repository state persisted correctly
- [ ] Subsequent clone returns correct repository
- [ ] Error handled gracefully (invalid packs, etc)
