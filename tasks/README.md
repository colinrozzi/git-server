# Tasks Management

This directory contains task descriptions and dependencies for implementing the Git Protocol v2 push functionality. Tasks are designed to be lightweight and evolve as we discover requirements.

## Task Organization

- Each task is a markdown file (`*.md`)
- Dependencies are listed at the top with `[DEP: task-name]` syntax
- Status tracking follows:
  - `📋 TODO` - Not started
  - `🔄 IN_PROGRESS` - Currently working on
  - `✅ COMPLETED` - Implemented and tested
  - `❌ BLOCKED` - Waiting on dependencies or external factors

## Task Lifecycle

1. Create task with dependencies
2. Split/merge tasks as boundaries become clearer
3. Update status as work progresses
4. Move completed tasks to `completed/` directory

## Task Templates

New tasks should include:
- Clear goal/desired outcome
- Current understanding of scope
- Dependencies (even fuzzy ones)
- Notes on what we discovered during implementation


**🚀 Ready for Testing!**
